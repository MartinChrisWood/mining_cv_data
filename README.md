# mining_cv_data


Demonstrates a text mining approach to creating useable location and "skill keyword"
variables from unstructured data.

As an aside, the data's actually pretty structured!  If I were serious I'd use that!

- Tech cv's dataset from https://dataturks.com/projects/abhishek.narayanan/Entity%20Recognition%20in%20Resumes
- Bias is Indian tech filter!

- The job descriptions dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/madhab/jobposts
- Bias is Armenian jobs portal!
